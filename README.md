# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results.

- Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
- Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
- Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The COUNTIFS() function accepts several criteria, like a cell range for the column of interest and the criteria to filter data from that column. Using this Excel documentation (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842), I was able to get a better understanding od how to utilize this function.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. In December, nearly the same amount of goals were failed as were successful.

2. No goals were canceled in October, but this month saw the hightest % of goals failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. The percentage canceled saw a positive correlation to the goal amount

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1. No way to determine how funds were allocated. 

2. The data is stagnet with no way to update without manual inputs.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. We could dig deeper into the dataset to determine if the length of the blurb affects the amount pledged.

2. We could utilize a pie chart to represent the projects competed successfully vs. failed vs. canceled.
